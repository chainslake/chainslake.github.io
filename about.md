Sign up and start using it for free [here](https://metabase.chainslake.io) or view this [demo dashboard](https://metabase.chainslake.io/public/dashboard/ac9dbee4-af29-4ba8-b494-eae69f4ee835){:target="_blank"}.
- __Data Engineer__: who build [Job pipelines](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/job-pipeline) to transform raw data into tables of data useful for querying.
- __Developer__: Program [Data applications](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/data-application) running on Chainslake to fetch data from new data sources (e.g. new chains).


## Chainslake specifications

## Chainslake features

Chainslake is built for blockchain data builders, it is open and free, easy to join. Builders just need to focus on their business, no need to worry about data.

## How to get start

- If you are new, Chainslake encourages you to sign up for an account [here](https://metabase.chainslake.io) and start building dashboards from the data tables available on Chainslake, we have a good example for you [here](https://metabase.chainslake.io/dashboard/60-erc20-token).
- If you are already proficient in building dashboards from existing tables and want to build new tables, let start with [SQL Transformer](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/data-app-store/#sql-transformer) which is an application for building tables in SQL language. You will need to read about [table design](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/table-design) and [job pipeline](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/job-pipeline) before you can start building tables.
- Finally, if you need to add new data (e.g. new chains, data from other centralized exchanges), or need a special transformation that SQL cannot perform. You will need to build a new [Data App](https://docs.chainslake.io/docs/data-application) for your needs.

## Self-hosted deployment

Chainslake offers a self-hosted version that allows users to deploy the Chainslake platform on their own infrastructure such as On-premise, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Databricks... Please contact us for cooperation.
