# Chainslake

**Chainslake** is a Blockchain Data Lakehouse framework, used to build the data warehouse for any EVM compatible blockchain. Chainslake download and decode data from [RPC](https://ethereum.org/vi/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/){:target="_blank"} and enable data pipeline construction to transform data, organize data into tables that can be queried in SQL language, and present results into charts and metrics in BI dashboards.

## Screenshot and Demo

The image below is a simple token analytics dashboard built on ethereum data in Chainslake's data warehouse. You can try it out in this [demo](https://metabase.chainslake.io/public/dashboard/db6301d1-9043-43fe-9c3e-ad2729d9b28e){:target="_blank"}.

Data tables are organized in folders for easy management.

Data is automatically updated by processing on the data pipeline.

## Why Chainslake

During the life cycle of protocols, smart contracts, wallets or chains generate a lot of data, how do we know how many wallets have interacted with a smart contract in a day?, or how to keep track revenue and profits from a protocol? To answer such questions you need a data warehouse for blockchain data, where you can write appropriate queries to get the results you need.

There have been a number of data warehouses on the market, such as [Dune](https://dune.com/) or [Footprint](https://www.footprint.network/). However, not all chains are supported, and not all protocols can decode data.

Chainslake brings you a technology solution so you can own, manage, operate and use blockchain data warehouse according to your own needs. Any EVM blockchain, any protocol (even the ones you develop yourself) are supported.

## How to Get Started

Just contact us, and we can start discussing plans to deploy Chainslake on your infrastructure. It usually takes about 2 weeks for the system to be ready for use. You will get a free trial for 1 month, after paying the setup fee, you will be able to use it indefinitely.
